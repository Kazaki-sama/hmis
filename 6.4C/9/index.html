                    <p>I am aware that in order to be cured of this form of tuberculosis, I need to take anti-TB drugs daily till the
                        end of my treatment. If I do not take these drugs daily, I am putting my own health at risk as well as the
                        health of family and community members. I commit to taking these drugs at this health center (sub-
                        center) till the end of my treatment. If I decide to leave this treatment, I understand the risk and
                        consequences of this disease.</p>
